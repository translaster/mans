### 1.1 Introduction

GoIP is the abbreviated from GSM over IP. It is a new type of VoIP gateway that allows call terminations from a VoIP network to a GSM network and vice versa. Call connections between IP networks and GSM networks are now bridged seamlessly to extend the voice communication coverage significantly. As the traditional PSTN lines are starting to disappear in developed countries and are not going to be built extensively in under-developed countries, GSM phones are getting more and more popular all over the world with lower and lower service charges, the emergence of GoIP bridges the gap between the traditional telephone networks and VoIP networks as shown in the diagram below. As a result, local and worldwide voice communications are more convenience, lower cost, and broader coverage.

You can now make a call from anywhere in the world via a VoIP network and then terminate the call via a GoIP to the local telephone network (PSTN). On the other hand, you can also make a call from the local telephone network to a GoIP (the GSM phone number) and then dial another number via a VoIP network to anywhere in the world. In these two cases, a VoIP Service provider is required for one side of the call termination. For two fixed locations, it is possible to setup GoIPs at both ends for call terminations without subscribing to a VoIP Service provider.
GoIP can also be used to achieve GSM roaming via VoIP. The idea is to route all your incoming GSM calls to a GoIP via call forward or simply insert your SIM card to a GoIP. You can then setup the GoIP to forward all incoming calls to another GSM number in the world via a VoIP service provider. The charge per call from a VoIP service provider is significantly lower than the roaming charge.
For office environment, GoIP offers a quick way to replace the traditional PSTN lines or T1/E1 lines to your IP PBX. There is no initial installation/reallocation charge and no need to wait for installation. Depending on our usage, you can add or remove lines as per your requirement. You can even configure the system so that everybody calls the same number regardless the number of lines available.
